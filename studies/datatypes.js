// Infinity and -Infinity (Google them if you don't know!)
// What is the difference between primitive/simple and complex data types?
// Primitive values are passed to a function BY COPY, complex values are BY REFERENCE. What does that mean, and how are they different?

/* There are a bunch of different data types that can be stored in 
   JavaScript - each of the datatypes stores a different type of 
   information and can be used in different ways.
*/

// 1. the first datatype is number - these are integers and floating decimal numbeers

var myNumber = 421;
